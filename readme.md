Robust, modern, lightweight, flexible.
======================================

Plinko.js is a lightweight framework written in HTML5 that blah blah blah blah.

Just drop in plinko,

``<script type="text/javascript" src="plinko.js"></script>``

And let the magic begin.

HTML5
=====

Plinko is exactly one version higher than HTML4 yet HTML6 ready.

Automatic doing
===============

With other frameworks, you have to do things manual, but with Plinko, things are different. With plinko, the difference between it and other frameworks, the ones that force you to do things manually is quite different. Plinko lets you take your code and--I lost my train of thought there. Plinko doesn't. Wait, sorry. The other frameworks are different. But Plinko is different. Shit, sorry, I just had this stupid argument with my girlfriend and I'm all like "ahh." So plinko is different from the way other frameworks are different. Plinko does things automatically.

You literally don't have to write any code. You don't even have to. No. You know how you were writing code last week? Forget it. Not with Plinko.

Think about the life you could have.
====================================

While you were writing JavaScript functions and running TDD deployments, your friends were out drinking and making love to beautiful people. You could have become a doctor if you wanted to. But instead, you had to buy that fucking mustang. Your mother and I are very disappointed in you.

But with Plinko, the secret sauce is in the HTML5.

Heath Ledger died.
==================

It's been years already. Can you believe it?...Man. Heath Ledger is dead.

Extending Plinko
================

You can't. It's physically impossible.
